My Name is Ashley! I currently work as a Senior Tech Talent Sourcer at Intuit but I am currently exploring Python and looking to move into a Software Engineer Career.  
I actually have previous experience as a Engineer early in my career, so it's cool to jump back into this space. 

Feel free to check out some of the projects that I have been working on!
